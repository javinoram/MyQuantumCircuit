# My first quantum circuit
This is my implementation of a quantum circuit implementation in c++. It's not a library, 
just a bump of classes that represent the quantum circuit and a toy example.

The main reason is learn and apply concepts of quantum computing and c++ OOP

## Execute the code
To execute your circuit, you must edit the makefile to use your file.

After that, you just use *make* and the compiled file will be created.
