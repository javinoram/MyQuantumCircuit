# My first quantum circuit
This is my implementation of a quantum circuit implementation in c++. It's not a library, 
just a bump of classes that represent the quantum circuit and a toy example.

The main reason is learn and apply concepts of quantum computing and c++ OOP

## How to use the code
The *g++ -std=c++14 -Wall files.cpp -o aux.out*
